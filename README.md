Yes — and here's the kicker:

Change **just one line** in your CSS to make the whole thing look *exactly* like WhatsApp's background.

Replace this line:
```css
background-color: e5ddd5;
```

With this **correctly formatted hex value**:
```css
background-color: #e5ddd5;
```

---

### Why?

Because right now you're using `e5ddd5` without the hash (`#`), so the browser treats it as an invalid value and defaults to plain white. Adding the `#` makes it valid CSS — and *that exact hex* (`#e5ddd5`) is the iconic WhatsApp chat background.

It’s the digital equivalent of green tea in a porcelain mug.

### Bonus:
If you want to go **full WhatsApp**, add this line inside `.chat-wrapper` for a tighter UI feel:

```css
gap: 6px;
```

And maybe round the messages a touch more:
```css
border-radius: 16px;
```

But really, that one `#` gives you the vibe.
